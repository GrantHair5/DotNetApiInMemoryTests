# DotNetApiInMemoryTests

This is an example of how to use `WebApplicationFactory<TEntryPoint>` to spin up an API in memory and write end to end tests against. 

I cannot stress how helpful this has been in the past and I will scream from the mountain tops how much I love testing. 

Please if you do one thing today, please write a test. 

### Notes

This api is obviously not that close to real life but shows some nice examples to get you running. 

### tl;dr; 

New XUnit project

Install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` 

`dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing`
